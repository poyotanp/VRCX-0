VRCX-0 is a ground-up rewrite of VRCX built on **Tauri + React**, replacing the original CefSharp + Vue stack. It is developed by one of VRCX's former maintainers.

VRCX-0 is designed for everyday use: dramatically lower resource usage, a smaller install, and an active development roadmap. As the upstream VRCX project has shifted toward maintenance, VRCX-0 is where new features are being built.

## Highlights

- **50%–70% lower memory usage** than VRCX
- Just over 10 MB to download, just over 30 MB on disk — over 10× smaller than VRCX
- **Background mode** — a step beyond minimizing to tray: opt in to drop memory
  to just tens of MB while all core features keep running normally
- **Social Automation** — auto-switch your status and bio based on time of day,
  instance type, or who you're with; auto-accept invite requests; restores your
  previous state when rules expire
- **Lightweight VR wrist overlay** with minimal performance impact; supports both
  OpenVR (SteamVR) and **OpenXR (Linux / WiVRn / Monado)**
- **Community Themes** — browse and install themes from a catalog, set a custom
  background image, and layer your own CSS on top
- **Three notification channels** — desktop notifications, text-to-speech, and VR
  overlay alerts, each independently configured per event type
- Full keyboard navigation
- Headless mode for advanced setups — see `crates/headless`
- Actively developed with new features on its own roadmap

## Data Migration

On first launch, VRCX-0 can automatically import your existing VRCX database and settings. Your original data is never modified — existing users can pick up right where they left off without any manual setup.
